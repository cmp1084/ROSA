\section*{Order for software modification}


\section*{Order overview}

We would like to order software modifications to the ROSA real time
operating system. The modifications need to be integrated into the
existing ROSA without breaking the old funcitonality. 

We need the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic creation of tasks
\item Priority scheduler
\item Semaphores
\item Immediate inheritance protocol
\item Premeptive scheduling
\end{itemize}
If possible, a message box system in the RTOS would be useful. 


\subsection*{Order details}


\subsubsection*{Dynamic creation of tasks}

We would like to be able to create and remove tasks on the fly. 


\subsubsection*{Priority scheduler}

The scheduler in ROSA is too simple for our needs. Some tasks we run
need to be at a higher priority. Arrangements for this in the code
would be really helpful.


\subsubsection*{Semaphores}

Today we have no option to protect our resources with semaphores.
This must be included into the system.


\subsubsection*{Immediate inheritance protocol}

With semaphores we can foresee some slight problems. Preferably we
would like to use the immediate inheritance protocol to solve those
problems. An option would be to also add PCP into ROSA.


\subsubsection*{Premeptive scheduling}

We need better control over the periodicity of our task execution.
Preferably we would like to have a periodicity in the millisecond
range.
