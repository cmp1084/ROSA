  Order for software modification

  Order overview

We would like to order software modifications to the ROSA real 
time operating system. The modifications need to be integrated 
into the existing ROSA without breaking the old funcitonality. 

We need the following features:

• Dynamic creation of tasks

• Priority scheduler

• Semaphores

• Immediate inheritance protocol

• Premeptive scheduling

If possible, a message box system in the RTOS would be useful. 

  Order details

  Dynamic creation of tasks

We would like to be able to create and remove tasks on the fly. 

  Priority scheduler

The scheduler in ROSA is too simple for our needs. Some tasks we 
run need to be at a higher priority. Arrangements for this in the 
code would be really helpful.

  Semaphores

Today we have no option to protect our resources with semaphores. 
This must be included into the system.

  Immediate inheritance protocol

With semaphores we can foresee some slight problems. Preferably 
we would like to use the immediate inheritance protocol to solve 
those problems. An option would be to also add PCP into ROSA.

  Premeptive scheduling

We need better control over the periodicity of our task 
execution. Preferably we would like to have a periodicity in the 
millisecond range.
